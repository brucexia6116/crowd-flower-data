4,18337284,4,"To test the non-inferiority of once-daily (QD) oral amoxicillin to the recommended twice-daily (BID) oral penicillin V in GABHS pharyngitis.
"
5,18337284,5,METHODS
6,18337284,6,This was a randomised non-inferiority trial carried out in a school-based clinic in New Zealand.
7,18337284,7,Children presenting with GABHS pharyngitis were randomised to oral amoxicillin 1500 mg QD (or 750 mg if bodyweight was <or=30 kg) or to oral penicillin V 500 mg BID (or 250 mg if bodyweight was <or=20 kg) for 10 days.

20,24726342,0,"Assessment of acute bronchodilator effects from specific airway resistance changes in stable COPD patients.

"
21,24726342,1,BACKGROUND
22,24726342,2,"In COPD patients, reversibility is currently evaluated from the changes of forced expiratory volume at 1s (ΔFEV1) and forced vital capacity (ΔFVC)."
23,24726342,3,"By lowering peripheral airway smooth muscle tone, bronchodilators should decrease dynamic hyperinflation, gas trapping, and possibly dyspnea at rest."
24,24726342,4,"Hence, we hypothesize that specific airway resistance changes (ΔsRAW) should better characterize the acute response to bronchodilators.
"
25,24726342,5,METHODS
26,24726342,6,"On two days, 60 COPD patients underwent dyspnea evaluation (VAS score) and pulmonary function testing at baseline and one hour after placebo or 300μg indacaterol administration.
"
27,24726342,7,"RESULTS Spirographic and ΔsRAW-based criteria identified as responders 24 and 45 patients, respectively."
28,24726342,8,"ΔsRAW correlated with changes of intrathoracic gas volume (ΔITGV) (r=0.61; p<0.001), residual volume (ΔRV) (r=0.60; p<0.001), ΔFVC (r=0.44; p=0.001), and ΔVAS (r=0.73; p<0.001), while ΔFEV1 correlated only with ΔFVC (r=0.34; p=0.008)."
29,24726342,9,"Significant differences in terms of ΔITGV (p=0.002), ΔRV (p=0.023), and ΔVAS (p<0.001) occurred only if patients were stratified according to ΔsRAW.
"
30,24726342,10,CONCLUSIONS
31,24726342,11,"In assessing the acute functional effect of bronchodilators, ΔsRAW-based criterion is preferable to FEV1-FVC-based criteria, being more closely related to bronchodilator-induced improvements of lung mechanics and dyspnea at rest.

54,24317958,2,"The aim of this study was to compare the efficiency of sonic, ultrasonic, and hydrodynamic devices in the removal of a root canal sealer from the surface and from simulated irregularities of root canals.
"
55,24317958,3,MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty-three root canals with two standardized grooves in the apical and coronal parts of longitudinally split roots were covered with AH Plus root canal sealer.
56,24317958,4,"Compared were the effects of (control) syringe irrigation, (1) CanalBrush, (2) passive ultrasonic irrigation, (3) EndoActivator, and (4) RinsEndo on the removal of the sealer."
57,24317958,5,The specimens were divided into four groups (N = 12) and one control group (N = 5) via randomization.
58,24317958,6,"The amount of remaining sealer in the root canal irregularities was evaluated under a microscope using a 4-grade scoring system, whereas the remaining sealer on the root canal surface was evaluated with a 7-grade scoring system.

60,24317958,8,"None of the techniques had a significant effect on cleaning the lateral grooves.
"
61,24317958,9,CONCLUSIONS
62,24317958,10,Within the limitations of this study protocol ultrasonic irrigation shows a superior effect on sealer removal from the root canal surface during endodontic retreatment.

83,8911222,17,CONCLUSIONS
84,8911222,18,The results of this study are consistent with previous research that has implicated a dysregulation in serotonin function in some patients with autism.

"
101,1968178,1,Changes in continuously recorded 'Finapres' finger blood pressure in ten normotensive and seven hypertensive subjects induced by self-inflation of the cuff or just wearing the inflated cuff were studied.
102,1968178,2,"Inflating the cuff caused an instantaneous rise in systolic blood pressure of 13 and 12 mm Hg (hypertensive and normotensive subjects, respectively)."
103,1968178,3,Wearing the inflated cuff did not change blood pressure.

"
120,24989854,1,BACKGROUND Social skills training (SST) is a common intervention for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) to improve their social and communication skills.
121,24989854,2,"Despite the fact that SSTs are often applied in clinical practice, the evidence for the effectiveness of these trainings for children with ASD is inconclusive."
122,24989854,3,"Moreover, long term outcome and generalization of learned skills are little evaluated."
123,24989854,4,"Additionally, there is no research on the influence of involvement of parents and teachers on effectiveness of SST and on the generalization of learned social skills to daily life."
124,24989854,5,"We expect parent and teacher involvement in SST to enhance treatment efficacy and to facilitate generalization of learned skills to daily life.

126,24989854,7,"In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with three conditions, 120 participants with ASD at the end of primary school (10-12 years of calendar age) have been randomized to SST, SST-PTI (SST with Parent & Teacher Involvement), or care-as-usual."
127,24989854,8,The SST consists of 18 group sessions of 1.5 hours for the children.
128,24989854,9,"In the SST-PTI condition, parents additionally participate in 8 parent sessions and parents and teachers are actively involved in homework assignments."
129,24989854,10,Assessment takes place at three moments: before and immediately after the intervention period and at 6 months follow-up.
130,24989854,11,"Primary outcome is socialization, as an aspect of adaptive functioning."
131,24989854,12,Secondary outcomes focus on specific social skills children learn during SST and on more general social skills pertaining to home and community settings from a multi-informant perspective.

"
210,26278470,2,"OBJECTIVE Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with poor insight has severe consequences for patients; nonetheless, no randomized controlled trial has ever been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of any treatment specifically for poor-insight OCD."
211,26278470,3,"A new psychotherapy for OCD, the inference-based approach (IBA), targets insight in OCD by strengthening normal sensory-driven reality testing."
212,26278470,4,"The goal of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of this new treatment to the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for patients with OCD with poor insight.
"
213,26278470,5,"METHOD A randomized controlled trial was conducted, in which 90 patients with OCD with poor insight received either 24 CBT sessions or 24 IBA sessions."
214,26278470,6,The primary outcome measure was the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS).
215,26278470,7,"Secondary outcome measures were level of insight, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and quality of life."

219,26278470,11,"Post hoc, in a small subgroup of patients with the worst insight (n = 23), it was found that the patients treated with the IBA reached a significantly higher OCD symptom reduction than the patients treated with CBT [estimated marginal mean = -7.77, t(219.45) ="
220,26278470,12,"-2.4, p = 0.017].
"
221,26278470,13,CONCLUSION Patients with OCD with poor insight improve significantly after psychological treatment.

"
240,19727232,3,METHODS A total of 81 cases of autistic children were selected through the standard of DSM-4 and clinical case study was used.
241,19727232,4,"They were divided randomly into experimental group and control one, and respectively received auditory integrative training and no training based on the multiple therapies."
242,19727232,5,The patients were investigated using clinical manifestation and Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) and intelligence quotient (IQ) before and after six months of treatment.
243,19727232,6,The effect was evaluated through the changes of clinical manifestations and scores of ABC and IQ.
244,19727232,7,"The changes of scores of IQ were determined with Gesell and WPPSI or WISC-R.
RESULTS Compared with 40 patients of the control group after the six months of the auditory integrative training, 41 of the experimental group had greatly improved in many aspects, such as the disorders of their language, social interactions and typical behavior symptoms while they had not changed in their abnormal behaviors."
245,19727232,8,The scores of IQ or DQ had increased and scores of ABC had dropped.
246,19727232,9,The differences between the two groups were greatly significant in statistics (P < 0.01).
247,19727232,10,"The decreasing level of both ABC scores and the increasing level of the IQ scores were negatively correlated with age, and the decreasing level of ABC scores was in line regression(positive correlation) with base IQ.

579,18189160,1,"Addition of epirubicin to adjuvant chemotherapy can provide important benefits for patients with early breast cancer, but the optimal dose remains unclear."
580,18189160,2,"Further improvements can be achieved with dose-dense regimens, but densification of fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (FEC) has proved difficult, with FEC(60) providing little benefit over standard chemotherapy and FEC(100) associated with toxicity."
581,18189160,3,We investigated the feasibility of two intermediate dose-dense FEC regimens.
582,18189160,4,"Patients were randomised to six cycles of FEC(75) or FEC(90), with all three drugs given on day 1 of each 14-day cycle."
583,18189160,5,Patients also received pegfilgrastim 6 mg as a single subcutaneous injection on day 2 of each cycle.
584,18189160,6,"The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects receiving > or =85% relative dose intensity and was achieved by 96% and 88% of patients in the FEC(75) and FEC(90) arms, respectively."
585,18189160,7,"Of 147 FEC(75) infusions, 4.1% were delayed, while 9.8% of 143 FEC(90) infusions were delayed."
586,18189160,8,The most common reasons for delay were adverse events and personal/logistical reasons.
587,18189160,9,"One dose reduction occurred during the study (FEC(90)), related to diarrhoea."
588,18189160,10,Grade 3-4 haematological toxicities were reported in two patients in the FEC(90) arm.
589,18189160,11,There were no incidences of febrile neutropenia during the study.
590,18189160,12,The most common adverse events were increases in liver enzymes and gastrointestinal events; no event resulted in discontinuation.
591,18189160,13,Only one patient (FEC(90)) experienced serious adverse events (vomiting and throat oedema).
592,18189160,14,"In conclusion, dose-dense FEC(75 )and FEC(90) are feasible with pegfilgrastim support."

"
597,16505427,3,"PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligible patients were randomly assigned at enrollment to receive three weekly doses of epoetin alfa 40,000 U subcutaneously (SC), followed by either standard weekly epoetin alfa (40K arm) or 120,000 U of epoetin alfa (120K arm) SC every 3 weeks for 18 additional weeks.
"
598,16505427,4,RESULTS Three hundred sixty-five patients were enrolled.
599,16505427,5,"One hundred eighty-three patients were assigned to the 40K arm, and 182 were assigned to the 120K arm."
600,16505427,6,"There was no difference in the proportion of patients requiring transfusions during the study (23% in 40K arm and 18% in 120K arm, P = .22) or specifically during the maintenance phase (13% in 40K arm v 15% in 120K arm, P = .58)."
601,16505427,7,"Patients randomly assigned to the 40K arm were more likely to have a > or = 2 or > or = 3 g/dL hemoglobin (Hb) increment, were more likely to have a drug dose held because of high Hb, and had higher mean end-of-study Hb levels."
602,16505427,8,"Toxicities, including thromboembolism, and overall survival were similar."
603,16505427,9,"Patients in the 40K arm had a higher global quality of life (QOL) at baseline for unclear reasons, whereas patients in the 120K arm had a greater global QOL improvement during the study, so end-of-study QOL was equivalent.

611,11454878,3,PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with measurable and assessable disease were randomized to receive either PLD 50 mg/m(2) as a 1-hour infusion every 4 weeks or topotecan 1.5 mg/m(2)/d for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks.
612,11454878,4,"Patients were stratified prospectively for platinum sensitivity and for the presence or absence of bulky disease.
"
613,11454878,5,RESULTS
614,11454878,6,A total of 474 patients were treated (239 PLD and 235 topotecan).
615,11454878,7,They comprised the intent-to-treat population.
616,11454878,8,The overall progression-free survival rates were similar between the two arms (P =.095).
617,11454878,9,"The overall response rates for PLD and topotecan were 19.7% and 17.0%, respectively (P =.390)."
618,11454878,10,Median overall survival times were 60 weeks for PLD and 56.7 weeks for topotecan.
619,11454878,11,"Data analyzed in platinum-sensitive patients demonstrated a statistically significant benefit from PLD for progression-free survival (P =.037), with medians of 28.9 for PLD versus 23.3 weeks for topotecan."
620,11454878,12,"For overall survival, PLD was significantly superior to topotecan (P =.008), with a median of 108 weeks versus 71.1 weeks."
621,11454878,13,The platinum-refractory subgroup demonstrated a nonstatistically significant survival trend in favor of topotecan (P =.455).
622,11454878,14,"Severe hematologic toxicity was more common with topotecan and was more likely to be associated with dosage modification, or growth factor or blood product utilization.
"
623,11454878,15,CONCLUSION

625,21106663,0,"Time-varying smoking abstinence predicts lower depressive symptoms following smoking cessation treatment.

"
626,21106663,1,INTRODUCTION
627,21106663,2,The question of whether abstinence during the months following a planned quit attempt exacerbates or improves depressive symptoms is an important clinical issue.
628,21106663,3,Extant research has primarily modeled between-person covariation between postquit abstinence and depressive symptom trajectories.
629,21106663,4,"However, this approach cannot account for potential third variables between participants that may affect both smoking and depression."
630,21106663,5,"Accordingly, the current study examined within-person covariation between time-varying abstinence and depressive symptom in a multilevel model (MLM), which allowed for transitions between smoking statuses within a participant.
"
631,21106663,6,METHODS Participants were 236 heavy drinking smokers in a randomized clinical trial testing the efficacy of incorporating brief alcohol intervention into smoking cessation treatment.
632,21106663,7,"Depressive symptoms and biochemically verified abstinence were assessed 1 week prior to and 2, 8, 16, and 26 weeks after quit date.
"
633,21106663,8,RESULTS MLMs indicated a slight increase in depressive symptoms over time in the sample as a whole.
634,21106663,9,"However, there was an inverse relation between time-varying abstinence (vs. smoking) and concurrent level of depressive symptoms, indicating that transitions from smoking to abstinence within individuals were associated with reductions in depressive symptoms.
"
635,21106663,10,CONCLUSIONS
636,21106663,11,"During the first 6 months following a planned quit attempt, being abstinent in a particular week appears to be associated with lower levels of concurrent depressive symptoms."
637,21106663,12,These results are not concordant with the view that intentional smoking abstinence exacerbates depressive symptoms.
638,21106663,13,"Efforts to promote smoking cessation should highlight that individuals are likely to feel more rather than less psychologically healthy when they successfully quit smoking.
