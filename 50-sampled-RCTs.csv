18337284,"Once-daily amoxicillin versus twice-daily penicillin V in group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis.

BACKGROUND Rheumatic fever is a preventable chronic disease preceded by group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis.
OBJECTIVE To test the non-inferiority of once-daily (QD) oral amoxicillin to the recommended twice-daily (BID) oral penicillin V in GABHS pharyngitis.
METHODS This was a randomised non-inferiority trial carried out in a school-based clinic in New Zealand. Children presenting with GABHS pharyngitis were randomised to oral amoxicillin 1500 mg QD (or 750 mg if bodyweight was <or=30 kg) or to oral penicillin V 500 mg BID (or 250 mg if bodyweight was <or=20 kg) for 10 days. Observed medication and weekend diary cards were used to monitor adherence.
OUTCOME Eradication of GABHS, determined with follow-up throat cultures on days 3-6, 12-16 and 26-36. GABHS isolates were serotyped to distinguish bacteriological treatment failures (and relapses) from new acquisitions. Non-inferiority was defined as an upper 95% confidence limit (CL) for the difference in success of eradication in the amoxicillin and penicillin V treatment groups of <or=10%.
RESULTS 353 children with positive throat swabs for GABHS were randomised to amoxicillin (n = 177) or penicillin V (n = 176). The upper 95% CL for the differences in positive cultures between the antibiotics was 4.9% at days 3-6, 6.5% at days 12-16 and 8.5% at days 26-36. Treatment failures (including relapses) occurred at each visit in 5.8%, 12.7% and 10.7% of amoxicillin recipients and 6.2%, 11.9% and 11.3% of penicillin V recipients, respectively. No significant differences in resolution of symptoms were noted between treatment groups. One case of unsubstantiated acute rheumatic fever occurred after 7 days of amoxicillin.
CONCLUSION In this adequately powered study, once-daily oral amoxicillin is not inferior to twice-daily penicillin V for the treatment and eradication of GABHS in children with pharyngitis.

24726342,"Assessment of acute bronchodilator effects from specific airway resistance changes in stable COPD patients.

BACKGROUND In COPD patients, reversibility is currently evaluated from the changes of forced expiratory volume at 1s (ΔFEV1) and forced vital capacity (ΔFVC). By lowering peripheral airway smooth muscle tone, bronchodilators should decrease dynamic hyperinflation, gas trapping, and possibly dyspnea at rest. Hence, we hypothesize that specific airway resistance changes (ΔsRAW) should better characterize the acute response to bronchodilators.
METHODS On two days, 60 COPD patients underwent dyspnea evaluation (VAS score) and pulmonary function testing at baseline and one hour after placebo or 300μg indacaterol administration.
RESULTS Spirographic and ΔsRAW-based criteria identified as responders 24 and 45 patients, respectively. ΔsRAW correlated with changes of intrathoracic gas volume (ΔITGV) (r=0.61; p<0.001), residual volume (ΔRV) (r=0.60; p<0.001), ΔFVC (r=0.44; p=0.001), and ΔVAS (r=0.73; p<0.001), while ΔFEV1 correlated only with ΔFVC (r=0.34; p=0.008). Significant differences in terms of ΔITGV (p=0.002), ΔRV (p=0.023), and ΔVAS (p<0.001) occurred only if patients were stratified according to ΔsRAW.
CONCLUSIONS In assessing the acute functional effect of bronchodilators, ΔsRAW-based criterion is preferable to FEV1-FVC-based criteria, being more closely related to bronchodilator-induced improvements of lung mechanics and dyspnea at rest.

20618920,"Effectiveness of hygienic-dietary recommendations as enhancers of antidepressant treatment in patients with depression: study protocol of a randomized controlled trial.

BACKGROUND In recent years some studies have been published supporting the efficacy of light exposure, physical activity, sleep control and a Mediterranean diet pattern on the improvement or prevention of depression. However, to our knowledge, there have been no studies using all these measures together as an adjuvant antidepressant strategy.
METHODS Multicenter, randomized, controlled, two arm-parallel, clinical trial. Eighty depressed patients undergoing standard antidepressant treatment will be advised to follow four additional hygienic-dietary recommendations about exercise, diet, sunlight exposure and sleep. Outcome measures will be assessed before and after the 6 month intervention period.
DISCUSSION We expect the patients in the active recommendations group to experience a greater improvement in their depressive symptoms. If so, this would be a great support for doctors who might systematically recommend these simple and costless measures, especially in primary care.

16427787,"Sleep-anticipating effects of melatonin in the human brain.

Melatonin, the hormone produced nocturnally by the pineal gland, is an endogenous regulator of the sleep-wake cycle. The effects of melatonin on brain activities and their relation to induction of sleepiness were studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. Melatonin, but not placebo, reduced task-related activity in the rostro-medial aspect of the occipital cortex during a visual-search task and in the auditory cortex during a music task. These effects correlated with subjective measurements of fatigue. In addition, melatonin enhanced the activation in the left parahippocampus in an autobiographic memory task. Results demonstrate that melatonin modulates brain activity in a manner resembling actual sleep although subjects are fully awake. Furthermore, the fatigue inducing effect of melatonin on brain activity is essentially different from that of sleep deprivation thus revealing differences between fatigues related to the circadian sleep regulation as opposed to increased homeostatic sleep need. Our findings highlight the role of melatonin in priming sleep-associated brain activation patterns in anticipation of sleep.

24317958,"The effect of four different irrigation systems in the removal of a root canal sealer.

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to compare the efficiency of sonic, ultrasonic, and hydrodynamic devices in the removal of a root canal sealer from the surface and from simulated irregularities of root canals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty-three root canals with two standardized grooves in the apical and coronal parts of longitudinally split roots were covered with AH Plus root canal sealer. Compared were the effects of (control) syringe irrigation, (1) CanalBrush, (2) passive ultrasonic irrigation, (3) EndoActivator, and (4) RinsEndo on the removal of the sealer. The specimens were divided into four groups (N = 12) and one control group (N = 5) via randomization. The amount of remaining sealer in the root canal irregularities was evaluated under a microscope using a 4-grade scoring system, whereas the remaining sealer on the root canal surface was evaluated with a 7-grade scoring system.
RESULTS Passive ultrasonic irrigation is more effective than the other tested irrigation systems or syringe irrigation in removing sealer from root canal walls (p < 0.01). None of the techniques had a significant effect on cleaning the lateral grooves.
CONCLUSIONS Within the limitations of this study protocol ultrasonic irrigation shows a superior effect on sealer removal from the root canal surface during endodontic retreatment. Cleaning of lateral grooves seems not to be possible with one of the techniques investigated.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE Incomplete removal of root canal sealer during re-treatment may cause treatment failure. Passive Ultrasonic irrigation seems to be the most effective system to remove sealer from a root canal.

8911222,"Effects of tryptophan depletion in drug-free adults with autistic disorder.

BACKGROUND The primary objective of this study was to investigate the behavioral and biochemical responses to acute tryptophan depletion in drug-free adult patients with autistic disorder.
METHODS Twenty drug-free adults with autistic disorder (16 men and 4 women) (mean [+/- SD] age, 30.5 +/- 8.5 years) underwent short-term tryptophan depletion in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover design. Patients received a 24-hour, low-tryptophan diet followed the next morning by an amino acid drink. Behavioral ratings were obtained on the morning of the amino acid drink (baseline) and 180, 300, and 420 minutes after the drink. Plasma free and total tryptophan levels were obtained at baseline and 5 hours after the drink. The active and sham testing sessions were separated by 7 days.
RESULTS Eleven (65%) of the 17 patients who completed both test days showed a significant global worsening of behavioral symptoms with short-term tryptophan depletion, but none of the 17 patients showed any significant change in clinical status from baseline after sham depletion (P = .001). Tryptophan depletion led to a significant increase in behaviors such as whirling, flapping, pacing, banging and hitting self, rocking, and toe walking (P < .05). In addition, patients were significantly less calm and happy and more anxious. No significant change was observed in social relatedness or repetitive thoughts and behavior. Plasma total and free tryptophan levels were reduced 86% and 69%, respectively, 5 hours after the tryptophan-deficient amino acid drink. Patients who had a significant global exacerbation of symptoms had significantly higher baseline plasma total tryptophan levels (P < .001) and Autism Behavior Checklist scores (P = .005) than did patients who showed no significant change in symptoms after tryptophan depletion.
CONCLUSIONS The results of this study are consistent with previous research that has implicated a dysregulation in serotonin function in some patients with autism. These data suggest that the short-term reduction of serotonin precursor availability may exacerbate some symptoms characteristic of autism in some patients. Continued investigation into the role of serotonin in the pathogenesis and treatment of autistic disorder is warranted.

3074300,"Role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in early antihypertensive treatment in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.

The effect of captopril monotherapy on blood pressure and metabolism was investigated in a placebo-controlled study in 30 non-insulin dependent (Type II) diabetic subjects during a 3-week observation period (run-in/drug; placebo/wash-out) on a metabolic ward. Captopril significantly reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (154/90 +/- 5/2 vs. 144/86 +/- 4/3 mmHg) without major side effects. Mean run-in postprandial blood glucose concentrations were also reduced upon ACE-inhibition (9 a.m.: 12.7 +/- 0.4 vs. 11.1 +/- 0.4 mmol/l; 1 p.m.: 11.0 +/- 0.3 vs. 8.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/l; P less than 0.05), while blood kinin concentrations (40.0 +/- 2.5 pmol/l) were approximately doubled (108.8 +/- 23.5 pmol/l; P less than 0.05). Body mass index, fasting plasma insulin, serum electrolyte pattern, uric acid, white blood count, lipid profile as well as hepatic and renal function parameters remained unaltered throughout the observation period. The data are in line with recent experimental studies showing a beneficial metabolic effect of captopril in Type II diabetes. ACE inhibitors might therefore become first-line drugs in early antihypertensive intervention in Type II diabetic patients.

1968178,"Effects of cuff inflation on self-recorded blood pressure.

Changes in continuously recorded 'Finapres' finger blood pressure in ten normotensive and seven hypertensive subjects induced by self-inflation of the cuff or just wearing the inflated cuff were studied. Inflating the cuff caused an instantaneous rise in systolic blood pressure of 13 and 12 mm Hg (hypertensive and normotensive subjects, respectively). Wearing the inflated cuff did not change blood pressure. Thus the rise in pressure was related to the muscular activity required for cuff inflation. Systolic blood pressure took on average 7 s and at most 21 s to return to baseline level after stopping cuff inflation. Since first Korotkoff sounds may already be heard after 10-15 s when following recommended procedures, self-recorded systolic blood pressure may be recorded as too high when subjects inflate their cuff at too low a pressure or deflate it too fast.

18783504,"Psychological mediators of bupropion sustained-release treatment for smoking cessation.

AIM The study aimed to test simultaneously our understanding of the effects of bupropion sustained-release (SR) treatment on putative mediators and our understanding of determinants of post-quit abstinence, including withdrawal distress, cigarette craving, positive affect and subjective reactions to cigarettes smoked during a lapse. The specificity of bupropion SR effects was also tested in exploratory analyses.
DESIGN Data from a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of bupropion SR were submitted to mediation analyses.
SETTING Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention, Madison, WI, USA.
PARTICIPANTS A total of 403 adult, daily smokers without contraindications to bupropion SR use.
INTERVENTION Participants were assigned randomly to receive a 9-week course of bupropion SR or placebo pill and to receive eight brief individual counseling sessions or no counseling.
MEASUREMENTS Ecological momentary assessment ratings of smoking behavior and putative mediators were collected pre- and post-quit.
FINDINGS Results of structural equation and hierarchical linear models did not support the hypothesis that bupropion SR treatment improves short-term abstinence by reducing withdrawal distress or affecting the subjective effects of a lapse cigarette, but provided partial support for mediation by cigarette craving reduction and enhanced positive affect. Bupropion SR effects on point-prevalence abstinence at 1 month post-quit were also mediated partially by enhanced motivation to quit and self-efficacy.
CONCLUSIONS Results provided some support for models of bupropion SR treatment and relapse and suggested that motivational processes may partially account for bupropion SR efficacy.

24989854,"A randomized controlled study of a social skills training for preadolescent children with autism spectrum disorders: generalization of skills by training parents and teachers?

BACKGROUND Social skills training (SST) is a common intervention for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) to improve their social and communication skills. Despite the fact that SSTs are often applied in clinical practice, the evidence for the effectiveness of these trainings for children with ASD is inconclusive. Moreover, long term outcome and generalization of learned skills are little evaluated. Additionally, there is no research on the influence of involvement of parents and teachers on effectiveness of SST and on the generalization of learned social skills to daily life. We expect parent and teacher involvement in SST to enhance treatment efficacy and to facilitate generalization of learned skills to daily life.
METHOD/DESIGN In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with three conditions, 120 participants with ASD at the end of primary school (10-12 years of calendar age) have been randomized to SST, SST-PTI (SST with Parent & Teacher Involvement), or care-as-usual. The SST consists of 18 group sessions of 1.5 hours for the children. In the SST-PTI condition, parents additionally participate in 8 parent sessions and parents and teachers are actively involved in homework assignments. Assessment takes place at three moments: before and immediately after the intervention period and at 6 months follow-up. Primary outcome is socialization, as an aspect of adaptive functioning. Secondary outcomes focus on specific social skills children learn during SST and on more general social skills pertaining to home and community settings from a multi-informant perspective. Additionally, possible predictors of treatment outcome will be assessed.
DISCUSSION The current study is an RCT study evaluating SST in a large sample of Dutch children with ASD in a specific age range (10-12 years). Strengths of the study are the use of one manualized protocol, application of standardized and internationally used rating instruments, use of multiple raters, investigation of generalization of learned skills to daily life, and the evaluation of efficacy in the longer term by follow-up measures at 6 months after the end of training.

2223363,"Effect of different rates of infusion of propofol for induction of anaesthesia in elderly patients.

The effect of changing the rate of infusion of propofol for induction of anaesthesia was studied in 60 elderly patients. Propofol was administered at 300, 600 or 1200 ml h-1 until loss of consciousness (as judged by loss of verbal contact with the patient) had been achieved. The duration of induction was significantly longer (P less than 0.001) with the slower infusion rates (104, 68 and 51 s), but the total dose used was significantly less (P less than 0.001) in these patients (1.2, 1.6 and 2.5 mg kg-1, respectively). The decrease in systolic and diastolic arterial pressure was significantly less in the 300-ml h-1 group at the end of induction and immediately after induction (P less than 0.01). The incidence of apnoea was also significantly less in the slower infusion group.

23114870,"Custom-fit minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty: effect on blood loss and early clinical outcomes.

PURPOSE Recently, new custom-fit pin guides in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) have been introduced. Use of these guides may reduce operating time. Use of the guides combined with the absence of intramedullary alignment jigs may lead to reduced blood loss and improved early outcomes. Our aim was to evaluate blood loss and early clinical outcomes in patients undergoing minimally invasive TKA using custom-fit magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based pin guides.
METHODS A prospective study in 80 patients was carried out. Patients were divided randomly into 2 equal groups. In one group, intramedullary alignment jigs were used. In the second group, custom-fit MRI-based pin guides were used. All patients received the same cemented posterior-stabilized implant through a mini-midvastus approach. The volume in the drain bottles was recorded after 48 h. Hb loss was estimated by subtracting the postoperative from the preoperative Hb level. Transfusion requirements and surgical time were recorded. Outcome measures were Knee Society Scores (KSS), knee flexion, knee swelling and pain.
RESULTS There was lower mean drainage of blood in the custom-fit group (391 ml vs. 603 ml; p < 0.0001). There was no difference in estimated loss of Hb (3.6 g/dl vs. 4.1 g/dl; n.s.) and in transfusion requirements (7.5 % vs. 10 %; n.s.). Surgical time was reduced in the custom-fit group (12 min less; p = 0.001). KSS measured at week 2, 6 and 12 showed no significant difference between groups. Knee flexion measured on days 7, 10 and at week 6, 12 and knee swelling and pain measured on days 1, 3, 10 and at week 6, 12 showed no significant difference between groups.
CONCLUSIONS Using custom-fit pin guides reduces blood drainage, but not the estimated Hb loss in minimally invasive TKA and does not affect transfusion rate. Surgical time is reduced. There is no effect on the early clinical outcomes.

361799,"[The chemotherapy of advanced breast cancer. A report on the first 600 cases in a cooperative programme to carry out a systematic study (1974-1977) (author's transl)].

The authors explain the objectives and the structure of a programme evolved for the methodic study of advanced breast cancers which they have worked out and carried out in cooperation with the departments of medicine in eight French anticancer centres. They analyse the initial phases, which correspond to the three first years of work. They give the state of the results that have been obtained in 603 patients using three protocols for treatment. These consisted of the administration in interrupted doses of chemotherapy which consisted of vincristine associated for the one part with cyclophosphamide and 5-fluoro-uracil and on the other hand with doxorubicine or/and with methotrexate. From this study there emerged the value of combined therapy using doxorubicine as much because of the frequency with which results better than 50% were obtained (in a randomised trial) as by their quality, which was made clear in an important series of 240 cases. They point out the conditions required to initiate the place of such a scheme in all complex therapy which aims as much at palliation as at cure, and point out how important it is to be methodical in the application of chemotherapy in order to ensure its development as an anticancer therapy.

This study examined the efficacy and safety of nifedipine sustained release (nifedipine SR) compared with Ginkgo biloba extract as treatment for primary Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) in Korea. Primary RP were screened and assigned to either the nifedipine SR group (Group N) or the Ginkgo biloba extract group (Group G) in the ratio of 2:1. After a run-in period of 2 weeks, patients received treatment for 8 weeks. We observed the percent improvement of the RP attack rate between before and after the 8-week treatment. Ninety-three subjects were randomly assigned. The percent improvement in Group N was 50.1% at 8 weeks after treatment, while it was 31.0% in Group G (p = 0.03). No serious adverse events occurred, and almost adverse events were mild and improved without specific treatment. nifedipine SR was more effective than Ginkgo biloba extract for treatment of primary RP in Korean patients. Both drugs were tolerable with primary RP patients.

11829043,"A pilot study on the effect of progressive muscle relaxation training of patients after stoma surgery.

Eighteen patients who had undergone stoma surgery were assessed with respect to their anxiety level and self-reported quality of life (QoL) on three occasions; namely, immediately after surgery, 5 weeks after surgery, and 10 weeks after surgery. The patients were randomised into a control group (n = 10) and an experimental group (n = 8). A 20-min set of audiotaped instructions on progressive muscle relaxation training (PMRT) was given to the patients in the experimental group for home practice. Assessment instructions included the Chinese State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (C-STAI), the Quality of Life Index for Colostomy (QoL-Colostomy) and the Hong Kong Chinese version of the World Health Organisation Quality of Life Scale (WHOQoL). Results indicated that there was a significant decrease in both the C-STAI score (F = 4.66, P < 0.05) and the WHOQoL score (F = 4.74, P < 0.05) in the experimental group. Among the domains of WHOQoL, a significant difference was shown in physical health/independence and general perception of QoL, with the experimental group demonstrating better functioning. For the QoL-Colostomy, however, there was no significant difference between the control and experimental groups. The results suggest that the use of PMRT could enhance quality of life and decrease state anxiety in patients after stoma surgery.

11381289,"Why were the results of the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial so astounding?

The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study was important because it showed the benefits of ramipril - an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor - in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events. Treatment with ramipril significantly reduced the rates of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, cardiac arrest and heart failure, as well as the risk of diabetes-related complications and of diabetes itself. The effects of therapy with vitamin E were also evaluated, but no statistical benefits were shown. The benefits of ACE inhibitor therapy that were observed were likely due to a variety of mechanisms, not just a reduction in blood pressure.

26278470,"Inference-Based Approach versus Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in the Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with Poor Insight: A 24-Session Randomized Controlled Trial.

OBJECTIVE Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with poor insight has severe consequences for patients; nonetheless, no randomized controlled trial has ever been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of any treatment specifically for poor-insight OCD. A new psychotherapy for OCD, the inference-based approach (IBA), targets insight in OCD by strengthening normal sensory-driven reality testing. The goal of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of this new treatment to the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for patients with OCD with poor insight.
METHOD A randomized controlled trial was conducted, in which 90 patients with OCD with poor insight received either 24 CBT sessions or 24 IBA sessions. The primary outcome measure was the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). Secondary outcome measures were level of insight, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and quality of life. Mixed-effects models were used to determine the treatment effect.
RESULTS In both conditions, a significant OCD symptom reduction was reached, but no condition effects were established. Post hoc, in a small subgroup of patients with the worst insight (n = 23), it was found that the patients treated with the IBA reached a significantly higher OCD symptom reduction than the patients treated with CBT [estimated marginal mean = -7.77, t(219.45) = -2.4, p = 0.017].
CONCLUSION Patients with OCD with poor insight improve significantly after psychological treatment. The results of this study suggest that both CBT and the IBA are effective treatments for OCD with poor insight. The IBA might be more promising than CBT for patients with more extreme poor insight.

BACKGROUND The Early Detection and Intervention Programme of the German Research Network on Schizophrenia (GRNS) investigates the initial prodromal phase of psychosis in a multidimensional approach. Two intervention strategies are being studied by two large-scale multicentre projects.
AIMS To present the concept of the intervention studies, and to provide an interim report of the recruitment procedure.
METHOD Comprehensive cognitive-behavioural therapy has been developed for patients in the ""early initial prodromal state"". For patients in the ""late initial prodromal state"" the atypical neuroleptic amisulpride is explored. Both interventions are evaluated in randomised controlled trials using clinical management as the control condition.
RESULTS Between January 2001 and March 2003, 1212 individuals seeking help for mental health problems were screened for putative prodromal symptoms at four university centres. More than 388 individuals fulfilled criteria for both interventions and 188 (48.5%) gave informed consent to participate in the trials.
CONCLUSIONS The screening procedure appears to be feasible and trial participation seems to be acceptable to a relevant proportion of people at increased risk of developing psychosis.

19727232,"[Effects of auditory integrative training on autistic children].

OBJECTIVE To explore the short-term treatment effect of the auditory integrative training on autistic children and provide them with clinical support for rehabilitative treatment.
METHODS A total of 81 cases of autistic children were selected through the standard of DSM-4 and clinical case study was used. They were divided randomly into experimental group and control one, and respectively received auditory integrative training and no training based on the multiple therapies. The patients were investigated using clinical manifestation and Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) and intelligence quotient (IQ) before and after six months of treatment. The effect was evaluated through the changes of clinical manifestations and scores of ABC and IQ. The changes of scores of IQ were determined with Gesell and WPPSI or WISC-R.
RESULTS Compared with 40 patients of the control group after the six months of the auditory integrative training, 41 of the experimental group had greatly improved in many aspects, such as the disorders of their language, social interactions and typical behavior symptoms while they had not changed in their abnormal behaviors. The scores of IQ or DQ had increased and scores of ABC had dropped. The differences between the two groups were greatly significant in statistics (P < 0.01). The decreasing level of both ABC scores and the increasing level of the IQ scores were negatively correlated with age, and the decreasing level of ABC scores was in line regression(positive correlation) with base IQ.
CONCLUSION The treatment of auditory integrative training (AIT) could greatly improve on language disorders, the difficulties of social interactions, typical behavior symptoms and developmental levels,therefore it is positive to the autistic children in its short-term treatment effect.

22271197,"Goal attainment scaling as an outcome measure in randomized controlled trials of psychosocial interventions in autism.

Goal attainment scaling (GAS) holds promise as an idiographic approach for measuring outcomes of psychosocial interventions in community settings. GAS has been criticized for untested assumptions of scaling level (i.e., interval or ordinal), inter-individual equivalence and comparability, and reliability of coding across different behavioral observation methods. We tested assumptions of equality between GAS descriptions for outcome measurement in a randomized trial (i.e., measurability, equidistance, level of difficulty, comparability of behavior samples collected from teachers vs. researchers and live vs. videotape). Results suggest GAS descriptions can be evaluated for equivalency, that teacher collected behavior samples are representative, and that varied sources of behavior samples can be reliably coded. GAS is a promising measurement approach. Recommendations are provided to ensure methodological quality.

14679127,"Long-term survival in a phase III, randomised study of topotecan versus paclitaxel in advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma.

BACKGROUND We have continued to monitor the survival of patients randomised in a previously reported multicentre phase III study of topotecan versus paclitaxel in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer who had failed one prior platinum-based regimen.
PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with bidimensionally measurable disease were randomised to topotecan (1.5 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days) or paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2)/day as a 3-h infusion) every 21 days. Patients were eligible for treatment with the alternate therapy at third line. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life (EORTC QOL)-C30 questionnaire was also used to measure eight symptoms at baseline and during each course (pain, anorexia, diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, dyspnea, constipation and insomnia).
RESULTS A total of 226 patients were evaluable for response. Demographic characteristics were similar in both treatment groups, as were results of the EORTC QOL-30 questionnaire. For the topotecan group, median time to progression was 18.9 weeks (range <1 to 92.6+ weeks; 25% censored), and, for paclitaxel, 14.7 weeks (range <1 to 137.3+ weeks; 12.3% censored); P = 0.076. At 4 years post-randomisation, median survival in the topotecan group was 63.0 weeks (range <1 to 238.4+ weeks; 20.5% censored) and, for paclitaxel, 53.0 weeks (range <1 to 226.3+ weeks; 12.3% censored); P = 0.44.
CONCLUSION Topotecan continues to demonstrate comparable efficacy and survival to paclitaxel with manageable and non-cumulative haematological toxicity. Non-haematological toxicity was generally mild for both groups. The long-term survival rate indicates substantial therapeutic benefit for this group of patients receiving topotecan at relapse of ovarian cancer.

In study group, the positive factor, negative factor and total scores of PANSS in the 12(th) weekend of treatment [(12.0 ± 2.8), (12.1 ± 3.6), (50.2 ± 8.7)] were all significantly lower than those in the 6(th) weekend of treatment [(14.2 ± 1.8), (14.6 ± 2.4), (56.5 ± 6.4)] (t = 2.58-4.26, P < 0.05). In the 12(th) weekend of treatment, the factors and total scores of PANSS in study group [(12.0 ± 2.8), (12.1 ± 3.6), (26.2 ± 5.0), (50.2 ± 8.7)] were all significantly lower than those in control group [(16.9 ± 4.9), (18.7 ± 5.3), (32.5 ± 5.1), (68.1 ± 13.0)] (t = -4.28--5.67, P < 0.05). In study group, the total scores of SDSS in the 12(th) weekend of treatment (5.93 ± 2.78) were significantly lower than those at baseline (13.9 ± 3.4) (t = 10.83, P < 0.05). In study group, the total scores of SDSS in the 12(th) weekend of treatment (5.9 ± 2.8) were significantly lower than those in the 6(th) weekend of treatment (7.6 ± 2.9) (t = 5.21, P < 0.05). But there was no significant improvement in control group (t = 1.88, P > 0.05). In the 12(th) weekend of treatment, the total scores of SDSS in study group (5.9 ± 2.8) were significantly lower than those in control group (8.8 ± 2.9) (t = -4.49, P < 0.05). No severe adverse effect was reported in either group.
CONCLUSION Paliperidone extended-release tablets are effective to improve social functions and psychiatric symptoms of schizophrenics.

8916620,"Analysis of prevention program effectiveness with clustered data using generalized estimating equations.

Experimental studies of prevention programs often randomize clusters of individuals rather than individuals to treatment conditions. When the correlation among individuals within clusters is not accounted for in statistical analysis, the standard errors are biased, potentially resulting in misleading conclusions about the significance of treatment effects. This study demonstrates the generalized estimating equations (GEE) method, focusing specifically on the GEE-independent method, to control for within-cluster correlation in regression models with either continuous or binary outcomes. The GEE-independent method yields consistent and robust variance estimates. Data from project DARE, a youth substance abuse prevention program, are used for illustration.

9229602,"[Antazoline/tetryzoline eyedrops in comparison with levocabastine eyedrops in acute allergic conjunctivitis].

BACKGROUND Allergic conjunctivitis is one of the most frequent allergic diseases of the anterior eye segment.
METHODS This multicentre, clinical trial was an investigation to compare the antiallergic efficacy, local tolerance and safety of Antazolin/Tetryzolin eye drops and Levocabastine eye drops. 69 patients were treated over a 2 weeks course of therapy. The subjective and objective ocular symptoms were documented over the treatment period.
RESULTS Both eye drops reduced subjective and objective ocular symptoms effective. The difference between the treatments (p = 0.0395) was the faster onset of action of Antazolin/Tetryzolin 30 minutes after administration of the first drop of trial medication.
CONCLUSION A fast and effective onset of action is of high clinical relevance. Therefore the benefits of using Antazolin/Tetryzolin eye drops was clearly outweigh.

21491990,"A novel approach to the use of subgingival controlled-release chlorhexidine delivery in chronic periodontitis: a randomized clinical trial.

BACKGROUND We aimed to analyze clinical, microbiologic, and serologic effects of chlorhexidine (CHX) chips used as a subgingival controlled-release delivery device before and immediately after scaling and root planing (SRP).
METHODS Twenty-four patients presenting with ≥12 teeth with probing depth (PD) ≥5 mm and bleeding on probing were assigned in test or control groups. After prophylaxis, CHX chips (test) or placebo chips (control) were placed in pockets with PD ≥5 mm. Ten days later, SRP was performed in all teeth with PD ≥4 mm in a single appointment. Immediately after SRP, new chips were inserted in all pockets with PD ≥5 mm. Parameters were assessed at baseline; beginning of SRP; and 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment. Subgingival samples were obtained at baseline; beginning of SRP; and at 1 month after treatment. Periodontal pathogens Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola were analyzed. Serum levels of high sensitive C-reactive and lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins were measured. The changes of the parameters between and within the groups were tested by Mann-Whitney U test (P <0.05).
RESULTS All clinical and serologic parameters improved in both groups over time. There was a significant difference in clinical attachment level (CAL) gain from baseline to 6 months between groups (1.17 mm in the test group versus 0.79 mm in the placebo group) (P <0.05). The treatment with CHX chips showed a greater reduction of the microorganisms of the ""red complex"" after 1 month (P = 0.02).
CONCLUSION The use of CHX chips before and immediately after SRP improved CAL and reduced the subgingival microorganisms of the red complex in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.

14679127,"Long-term survival in a phase III, randomised study of topotecan versus paclitaxel in advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma.

BACKGROUND We have continued to monitor the survival of patients randomised in a previously reported multicentre phase III study of topotecan versus paclitaxel in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer who had failed one prior platinum-based regimen.
PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with bidimensionally measurable disease were randomised to topotecan (1.5 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days) or paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2)/day as a 3-h infusion) every 21 days. Patients were eligible for treatment with the alternate therapy at third line. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life (EORTC QOL)-C30 questionnaire was also used to measure eight symptoms at baseline and during each course (pain, anorexia, diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, dyspnea, constipation and insomnia).
RESULTS A total of 226 patients were evaluable for response. Demographic characteristics were similar in both treatment groups, as were results of the EORTC QOL-30 questionnaire. For the topotecan group, median time to progression was 18.9 weeks (range <1 to 92.6+ weeks; 25% censored), and, for paclitaxel, 14.7 weeks (range <1 to 137.3+ weeks; 12.3% censored); P = 0.076. At 4 years post-randomisation, median survival in the topotecan group was 63.0 weeks (range <1 to 238.4+ weeks; 20.5% censored) and, for paclitaxel, 53.0 weeks (range <1 to 226.3+ weeks; 12.3% censored); P = 0.44.
CONCLUSION Topotecan continues to demonstrate comparable efficacy and survival to paclitaxel with manageable and non-cumulative haematological toxicity. Non-haematological toxicity was generally mild for both groups. The long-term survival rate indicates substantial therapeutic benefit for this group of patients receiving topotecan at relapse of ovarian cancer.

11642083,"[Neoton and thrombolytic therapy of myocardial infarction].

AIM To evaluate neoton therapy effects in acute myocardial infarction (MI) on systolic function of the left ventricle, arrhythmia and clinical symptoms in patients on thrombolytic therapy (TLT).
MATERIAL AND METHODS 106 males with Q-MI entered the study. 47 received treatment without TLT and neoton, 30 patients received TLT with streptokinase preparations, 29 patients were given streptokinase preparations and neoton. Left ventricular systolic function was measured by echocardiography on day 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28; arrhythmia was analysed at Holter monitoring in day 1 and 2 of MI.
RESULTS TLT failed to arrest progression of left ventricular dilation by the end of the hospital stay. Patients given neoton in acute period of MI had no increase in the end systolic and diastolic volumes of the left ventricle in the course of the first months after MI onset. Antiarrhythmic action of neoton manifested on MI day 2.
CONCLUSION Neoton given to MI patients receiving TLT prevents progression of left ventricular systolic dysfunction and establishment of predictors of unfavourable outcome.

8989009,"Prevention of spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension in the elderly: comparison between preanesthetic administration of crystalloids, colloids, and no prehydration.

The practice of routinely prehydrating patients by infusing a crystalloid or colloid solution (up to 1.0 L/70 kg) for prevention of spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension has been challenged recently, after several reports of failure to demonstrate its efficacy in young women. We compared the incidence and frequency of hypotension and vasopressor therapy after spinal anesthesia and no prehydration with crystalloid and colloid prehydration in elderly patients. Eighty-five ASA grade I or II patients (aged 60-89 yr) for elective total hip replacement were randomized to receive 500 mL crystalloid solution (Hartmanns, n = 29), 500 mL colloid (Haemaccel, n = 28), or no prehydration (n = 28) over 10 min prior to spinal anesthesia. Hypotension was defined as a 30% decrease from baseline systolic blood pressure (BP) or systolic < 90 mm Hg, and was treated with ephedrine 3-mg boluses. Although absolute systolic BP readings were significantly higher in the colloid group between 6 and 30 min (P < 0.05), the incidence of hypotension was not significantly different between the groups. The incidence of ephedrine use, incidence of nausea/vomiting, and median total dose of ephedrine were similar in all groups. We conclude that, in elderly patients undergoing elective procedures, withholding prehydration is not associated with any greater degree of hypotension or need for vasopressor therapy compared with crystalloid or colloid prehydration.

20739054,"Eltrombopag for management of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (RAISE): a 6-month, randomised, phase 3 study.

BACKGROUND Eltrombopag is an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist for the treatment of thrombocytopenia. We aimed to compare the response to once daily eltrombopag versus placebo in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia during a 6-month period.
METHODS We undertook a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adults with previously treated immune thrombocytopenia of more than 6 months' duration who had baseline platelet counts lower than 30,000 per μL. Patients were randomly allocated (in a 2:1 ratio) treatment with local standard of care plus 50 mg eltrombopag or matching placebo once daily for 6 months. Randomisation was done centrally with a computer-generated randomisation schedule and was stratified by baseline platelet count (≤ 15,000 per μL), use of treatment for immune thrombocytopenia, and splenectomy status. Patients, investigators, and those assessing data were masked to allocation. Dose modifications were made on the basis of platelet response. Patients were assessed for response to treatment (defined as a platelet count of 50,000-400,000 per μL) weekly during the first 6 weeks and at least once every 4 weeks thereafter; the primary endpoint was the odds of response to eltrombopag versus placebo. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00370331.
FINDINGS Between Nov 22, 2006, and July 31, 2007, 197 patients were randomly allocated to treatment groups and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (135 eltrombopag, 62 placebo). 106 (79%) patients in the eltrombopag group responded to treatment at least once during the study, compared with 17 (28%) patients in the placebo group. The odds of responding were greater in patients in the eltrombopag group compared with those in the placebo group throughout the 6-month treatment period (odds ratio 8·2, 99% CI 3·59-18·73; p<0·0001). 37 (59%) patients receiving eltrombopag reduced concomitant treatment versus ten (32%) patients receiving placebo (p=0·016). 24 (18%) patients receiving eltrombopag needed rescue treatment compared with 25 (40%) patients receiving placebo (p=0·001). Three (2%) patients receiving eltrombopag had thromboembolic events compared with none in patients on placebo. Nine (7%) eltrombopag-treated patients and two (3%) in the placebo group had mild increases in alanine aminotransferase concentration, and five (4%) eltrombopag-treated patients (vs none allocated to placebo) had increases in total bilirubin. Four (7%) patients taking placebo had serious bleeding events, compared with one (<1%) patient treated with eltrombopag.
INTERPRETATION Eltrombopag is effective for management of chronic immune thrombocytopenia, and could be particularly beneficial for patients who have not responded to splenectomy or previous treatment. These benefits should be balanced with the potential risks associated with eltrombopag treatment.

361799,"[The chemotherapy of advanced breast cancer. A report on the first 600 cases in a cooperative programme to carry out a systematic study (1974-1977) (author's transl)].

The authors explain the objectives and the structure of a programme evolved for the methodic study of advanced breast cancers which they have worked out and carried out in cooperation with the departments of medicine in eight French anticancer centres. They analyse the initial phases, which correspond to the three first years of work. They give the state of the results that have been obtained in 603 patients using three protocols for treatment. These consisted of the administration in interrupted doses of chemotherapy which consisted of vincristine associated for the one part with cyclophosphamide and 5-fluoro-uracil and on the other hand with doxorubicine or/and with methotrexate. From this study there emerged the value of combined therapy using doxorubicine as much because of the frequency with which results better than 50% were obtained (in a randomised trial) as by their quality, which was made clear in an important series of 240 cases. They point out the conditions required to initiate the place of such a scheme in all complex therapy which aims as much at palliation as at cure, and point out how important it is to be methodical in the application of chemotherapy in order to ensure its development as an anticancer therapy.

19096921,"Trial design challenges when combining medication and parent training in children with pervasive developmental disorders.

This paper presents the rationale for a 24-week, randomized trial designed to test whether risperidone plus structured parent training would be superior to risperidone only on measures of noncompliance, irritability and adaptive functioning. In this model, medication reduces tantrums, aggression and self-injury; parent training promotes improvement in noncompliance and adaptive functioning. Thus, medication and parent training target related, but separate, outcomes. At week 24, the medication was gradually withdrawn to determine whether subjects in the combined treatment group could be managed on a lower dose or off medication without relapse. Both symptom reduction and functional improvement are important clinical treatment targets. Thus, experimental evidence on the beneficial effects of combining pharmacotherapy and exportable behavioral interventions is needed to guide clinical practice.

14763035,"A selective angiotensin receptor antagonist, Valsartan, produced regression of left ventricular hypertrophy associated with a reduction of arterial stiffness.

We investigated whether a selective angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) would have a regressive effect on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). In a double-blind study, 24 CAPD patients with LVH [left ventricular mass index (LVMi) > 110 g/m2 for women and LVMi > 137 g/m2 for men] were randomized to 12 months' administration of either the ARB valsartan (n = 14) or a placebo (n = 10). The target blood pressure (BP) was 140/90 mmHg or lower in both groups. The following parameters were measured before and at the end of the study: aortic and large-artery compliance and arterial wave reflections [pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AI) application tonometry] and cardiac echocardiography. Periodically recorded were body weight, BP (mercury sphygmomanometer), serum creatinine, electrolytes, complete blood cell counts, urine volume, drainage volume, and weekly creatinine clearance. Two-way analysis of variance for repeated measurements was used for statistical analysis. Systolic and diastolic BP were both reduced in patients treated with ARB. The LVMi was significantly reduced in patients treated with ARB (to 121 +/- 4 from 145 +/- 5) but not in those receiving placebo (to 137 +/- 3 from 152 +/- 3, p < 0.05). The decrease in LVMi was associated with a reduction in PWV and AI. In CAPD patients with LVH, ARB reduced LVMi in association with alterations in arterial hemodynamics.

22744141,"Parent-implemented enhanced milieu teaching with preschool children who have intellectual disabilities.

PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of enhanced milieu teaching (EMT) implemented by parents and therapists versus therapists only on the language skills of preschool children with intellectual disabilities (IDs), including children with Down syndrome and children with autism spectrum disorders.
METHOD Seventy-seven children were randomly assigned to 2 treatments (parent + therapist EMT or therapist-only EMT) and received 36 intervention sessions. Children were assessed before, immediately after, 6 months after, and 12 months after intervention. Separate linear regressions were conducted for each standardized and observational measure at each time point.
RESULTS Parents in the parent + therapist group demonstrated greater use of EMT strategies at home than untrained parents in the therapist-only group, and these effects maintained over time. Effect sizes for observational measures ranged from d = 0.10 to d = 1.32 favoring the parent + therapist group, with the largest effect sizes found 12 months after intervention.
CONCLUSION Findings from this study indicate generally that there are benefits to training parents to implement naturalistic language intervention strategies with preschool children who have ID and significant language impairments.

22341427,"Intermediate-term mortality and cardiac transplantation in infants with single-ventricle lesions: risk factors and their interaction with shunt type.

OBJECTIVE The study objective was to identify factors associated with death and cardiac transplantation in infants undergoing the Norwood procedure and to determine differences in associations that might favor the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt or a right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt.
METHODS We used competing risks methodology to analyze death without transplantation, cardiac transplantation, and survival without transplantation. Parametric time-to-event modeling and bootstrapping were used to identify independent predictors.
RESULTS Data from 549 subjects (follow-up, 2.7 ± 0.9 years) were analyzed. Mortality risk was characterized by early and constant phases; transplant was characterized by only a constant phase. Early phase factors associated with death included lower socioeconomic status (P = .01), obstructed pulmonary venous return (P < .001), smaller ascending aorta (P = .02), and anatomic subtype. Constant phase factors associated with death included genetic syndrome (P < .001) and lower gestational age (P < .001). The right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt demonstrated better survival in the 51% of subjects who were full term with aortic atresia (P < .001). The modified Blalock-Taussig shunt was better among the 4% of subjects who were preterm with a patent aortic valve (P = .003). Lower pre-Norwood right ventricular fractional area change, pre-Norwood surgery, and anatomy other than hypoplastic left heart syndrome were independently associated with transplantation (all P < .03), but shunt type was not (P = .43).
CONCLUSIONS Independent risk factors for intermediate-term mortality include lower socioeconomic status, anatomy, genetic syndrome, and lower gestational age. Term infants with aortic atresia benefited from a right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt, and preterm infants with a patent aortic valve benefited from a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt. Right ventricular function and anatomy, but not shunt type, were associated with transplantation.

24803369,"Youth with autism spectrum disorder comprehend lexicalized and novel primary conceptual metaphors.

Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficulty comprehending metaphors. However, no study to date has examined whether or not they understand conceptual metaphors (i.e. mappings between conceptual structures), which could be the building blocks of metaphoric thinking and understanding. We investigated whether 13 participants with ASD (age 7;03-22;03) and 13 age-matched typically developing (TD) controls could comprehend lexicalized conceptual metaphors (e.g., Susan is a warm person) and novel ones (e.g., Susan is a toasty person). Individuals with ASD performed at greater than chance levels on both metaphor types, although their performance was lower than TD participants. We discuss the theoretical relevance of these findings and educational implications.

BACKGROUND The Early Detection and Intervention Programme of the German Research Network on Schizophrenia (GRNS) investigates the initial prodromal phase of psychosis in a multidimensional approach. Two intervention strategies are being studied by two large-scale multicentre projects.
AIMS To present the concept of the intervention studies, and to provide an interim report of the recruitment procedure.
METHOD Comprehensive cognitive-behavioural therapy has been developed for patients in the ""early initial prodromal state"". For patients in the ""late initial prodromal state"" the atypical neuroleptic amisulpride is explored. Both interventions are evaluated in randomised controlled trials using clinical management as the control condition.
RESULTS Between January 2001 and March 2003, 1212 individuals seeking help for mental health problems were screened for putative prodromal symptoms at four university centres. More than 388 individuals fulfilled criteria for both interventions and 188 (48.5%) gave informed consent to participate in the trials.
CONCLUSIONS The screening procedure appears to be feasible and trial participation seems to be acceptable to a relevant proportion of people at increased risk of developing psychosis.

2803397,"[The sympatho-adrenergic stress reaction in ear surgery using various anesthesia technics].

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of various anaesthetic procedures on the endocrine stress responses during ear microsurgical operations. Simple mastoidectomies, radical mastoidectomies and tympano plastics were carried out in 49 patients under the following randomised anaesthetic procedures: Group 1 halothane anaesthesia and retroauricular infiltration anaesthesia with lidocaine and ornipressin (n = 14), Group 2 fentanyl anaesthesia and retroauricular anaesthesia with lidocaine and ornipressin (n = 10), Group 3 fentanyl anaesthesia and retroauricular infiltration anaesthesia with lidocaine and epinephrine (n = 14), and Group 4 retroauricular infiltration anaesthesia with prilocaine and epinephrine (n = 14). The plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, glucose, lactate and free glycerol were measured in addition to mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) immediately before anaesthesia, 10 minutes after skin incision, 10 minutes after having started bone drilling, at the end of the operation and 3 hours after operation. All data were subjected to covariance analysis including the age factor. Plasma catecholamine concentrations remained within the normal range during the investigation in patients subjected to general anaesthesia (Groups 1-3). Plasma catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) increased significantly in Group 4 (retroauricular infiltration anaesthesia). There were no group variabilities with regard to MAP and HR. The plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine demonstrate a direct response to stress followed by a secondary change in glucose, lactate and free glycerol. The beneficial effect of general anaesthesia is documented by normal plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine throughout the operation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

7831628,"Measurement of transfer factor during constant exhalation.

BACKGROUND Transfer factor of the lung for carbon monoxide (TLCO) was measured by a new method based on analysis of the ratio of the concentrations of carbon monoxide to an inert gas (methane) relative to lung volume during a constant exhalation. Since this new technique is based solely upon exhalation, anomalies associated with inspiration and breath holding do not affect results. Additionally, because prolonged breath holding is not required, measurements can readily be made in dyspnoeic patients.
METHODS Exhalation TLCO (TLCO,ex) was compared with the standard (Jones and Meade) 10 second breath holding TLCO (TLCO,bh) in 100 consecutive patients. Patients did not practise the exhalation manoeuvre prior to testing.
RESULTS The comparative results were very close; mean difference (bias) +/- standard deviation (precision) was 0.05 (0.84) mmol/min/kPa. The relation was equally strong in patients with severe pulmonary disease; for patients with FEV1 < 1.51 the mean difference was 0.21 (0.80) mmol/min/kPa.
CONCLUSIONS Since the results were essentially identical between the techniques, it seems that comparable pathophysiological factors affect TLCO during breath holding and constant exhalation. Constant exhalation may therefore be a useful alternative to the breath holding technique for clinical measurement of TLCO.

17897478,"Salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate versus fluticasone propionate plus montelukast: a randomised controlled trial investigating the effects on airway inflammation in asthma.

BACKGROUND Few studies have compared treatment strategies in patients with asthma poorly controlled on low dose inhaled corticosteroids, and little is known about the effects of different treatments on airway inflammation. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study, we compared the effects of salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate (FP) (Seretide; SFC) and FP plus montelukast (FP/M) on sputum inflammatory markers, airway responsiveness, lung function, and symptoms in adult asthmatics.
METHODS Sixty-six subjects were randomised to SFC or FP/M for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was changes in neutrophil, eosinophil, macrophage, lymphocyte, and epithelial cell levels in induced sputum. Additional outcomes included the change in other sputum markers of airway inflammation, airway responsiveness, symptom control, and lung function.
RESULTS Both treatments had no significant effect on induced sputum inflammatory cells, although there was a trend for a reduction in sputum eosinophils. Both treatments significantly improved airway responsiveness, whereas SFC generally led to greater improvements in symptom control and lung function than FP/M. FP/M led to significantly greater reductions in sputum cysteinyl leukotrienes than SFC (treatment ratio 1.80; 95% CI 1.09, 2.94).
CONCLUSION Both treatments led to similar control of eosinophilic airway inflammation, although PEF and symptom control were better with SFC. STUDY NUMBER: SAM40030 (SOLTA).

To determine the efficacy of intramuscular oxytetracycline as a supplemental dry cow treatment for Staphylococcus aureus mastitis, 37 Holstein cows were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: intracisternal infusion with a commercial preparation of cephapirin benzathine at drying off (20 cows) and infusion with cephapirin benzathine at drying off and intramuscular oxytetracycline at 11 mg/kg once daily on d 7, 8, 9, and 10 after drying off (17 cows). Milk samples collected 7, 14, 30, and 60 d after calving were plated for bacterial isolation within 24 h after collection and after 24 to 72 h of storage at -20 degrees C. Quarters were defined as infected if S. aureus was isolated from the fresh and frozen cultures from any one sample collected before drying off. An infected quarter was defined as cured if S. aureus was not isolated from the fresh or frozen culture from milk samples obtained following calving. The rate of cure by 30 d after calving for systemic oxytetracycline (in combination with cephapirin treatment) was 29.4% for infected quarters and 29.4% for infected cows, compared with 27.5 and 25.0%, respectively, for the cephapirin treatment only. Results including the culture at 60 d after calving were 21.2 and 22.5%, respectively, for combination therapy and cephapirin therapy only. Systemic oxytetracycline, in combination with intramammary dry cow treatment, did not improve the rate of cure for S. aureus mastitis.

8726604,"The effects of sevoflurane and isoflurane on recovery from outpatient surgery.

This randomized, open-label study compared the investigational inhalational anesthetic sevoflurane with isoflurane in 47 healthy women undergoing elective ambulatory surgery. The women were randomized to receive either sevoflurane or isoflurane in 60% nitrous oxide-oxygen. Induction with thiopental 3-6 mg/kg was followed by vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg and fentanyl 0-200 micrograms. Duration of anesthesia, time to emergence, orientation, length of stay in the surgical unit, and hospital discharge were recorded. The emergence, length of stay, and discharge times after discontinuation of sevoflurane were 9.7 +/- 0.7, 120.6 +/- 8.0, and 244 +/- 15 minutes, respectively, and for isoflurane were 11.9 +/- 1.4, 106.8 +/- 7.1, and 282 +/- 24 minutes, respectively (NS). The isoflurane group had a higher frequency of postoperative cough. At the end of surgery, the sevoflurane group received a deeper level of anesthesia (minimum alveolar concentration 1.5 vs 1.3), however, these patients were oriented earlier (13.6 +/- 1.1 min vs 17.0 +/- 1.5 min isoflurane; p = 0.02) after discontinuation of anesthesia, although this difference is of little clinical significance.

21975269,"Use of hormonal contraceptives and risk of HIV-1 transmission: a prospective cohort study.

BACKGROUND Hormonal contraceptives are used widely but their effects on HIV-1 risk are unclear. We aimed to assess the association between hormonal contraceptive use and risk of HIV-1 acquisition by women and HIV-1 transmission from HIV-1-infected women to their male partners.
METHODS In this prospective study, we followed up 3790 heterosexual HIV-1-serodiscordant couples participating in two longitudinal studies of HIV-1 incidence in seven African countries. Among injectable and oral hormonal contraceptive users and non-users, we compared rates of HIV-1 acquisition by women and HIV-1 transmission from women to men. The primary outcome measure was HIV-1 seroconversion. We used Cox proportional hazards regression and marginal structural modelling to assess the effect of contraceptive use on HIV-1 risk.
FINDINGS Among 1314 couples in which the HIV-1-seronegative partner was female (median follow-up 18·0 [IQR 12·6-24·2] months), rates of HIV-1 acquisition were 6·61 per 100 person-years in women who used hormonal contraception and 3·78 per 100 person-years in those who did not (adjusted hazard ratio 1·98, 95% CI 1·06-3·68, p=0·03). Among 2476 couples in which the HIV-1-seronegative partner was male (median follow-up 18·7 [IQR 12·8-24·2] months), rates of HIV-1 transmission from women to men were 2·61 per 100 person-years in couples in which women used hormonal contraception and 1·51 per 100 person-years in couples in which women did not use hormonal contraception (adjusted hazard ratio 1·97, 95% CI 1·12-3·45, p=0·02). Marginal structural model analyses generated much the same results to the Cox proportional hazards regression.
INTERPRETATION Women should be counselled about potentially increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition and transmission with hormonal contraception, especially injectable methods, and about the importance of dual protection with condoms to decrease HIV-1 risk. Non-hormonal or low-dose hormonal contraceptive methods should be considered for women with or at-risk for HIV-1.

BACKGROUND Rheumatic fever is a preventable chronic disease preceded by group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis.
OBJECTIVE To test the non-inferiority of once-daily (QD) oral amoxicillin to the recommended twice-daily (BID) oral penicillin V in GABHS pharyngitis.
METHODS This was a randomised non-inferiority trial carried out in a school-based clinic in New Zealand. Children presenting with GABHS pharyngitis were randomised to oral amoxicillin 1500 mg QD (or 750 mg if bodyweight was <or=30 kg) or to oral penicillin V 500 mg BID (or 250 mg if bodyweight was <or=20 kg) for 10 days. Observed medication and weekend diary cards were used to monitor adherence.
OUTCOME Eradication of GABHS, determined with follow-up throat cultures on days 3-6, 12-16 and 26-36. GABHS isolates were serotyped to distinguish bacteriological treatment failures (and relapses) from new acquisitions. Non-inferiority was defined as an upper 95% confidence limit (CL) for the difference in success of eradication in the amoxicillin and penicillin V treatment groups of <or=10%.
RESULTS 353 children with positive throat swabs for GABHS were randomised to amoxicillin (n = 177) or penicillin V (n = 176). The upper 95% CL for the differences in positive cultures between the antibiotics was 4.9% at days 3-6, 6.5% at days 12-16 and 8.5% at days 26-36. Treatment failures (including relapses) occurred at each visit in 5.8%, 12.7% and 10.7% of amoxicillin recipients and 6.2%, 11.9% and 11.3% of penicillin V recipients, respectively. No significant differences in resolution of symptoms were noted between treatment groups. One case of unsubstantiated acute rheumatic fever occurred after 7 days of amoxicillin.
CONCLUSION In this adequately powered study, once-daily oral amoxicillin is not inferior to twice-daily penicillin V for the treatment and eradication of GABHS in children with pharyngitis.

11099086,"Oral ciprofloxacin vs. intramuscular ceftriaxone as empiric treatment of acute invasive diarrhea in children.

BACKGROUND Acute invasive diarrhea is a potentially serious condition in children. Because of the increasing resistance of enteric pathogens to commonly used oral antibiotics, intramuscular ceftriaxone has become the routine drug in the treatment of acute invasive diarrhea requiring an emergency visit in southern Israel. The inconvenience of this parenteral regimen created an increased need for oral pediatric formulations for the treatment of invasive diarrhea.
OBJECTIVES To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a suspension formulation of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of acute invasive diarrhea in infants and children.
PATIENTS AND METHODS From July 1996 through December 1997, 201 evaluable children ages 6 months to 10 years (35% <1 year; 70% <3 years) presenting with acute invasive diarrhea at the Pediatric Emergency Room were randomized to receive either ciprofloxacin suspension (10 mg/kg twice a day + im placebo; n = 95) or im ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg/day + placebo suspension; n = 106) for 3 days in a double blind manner. Stool cultures for Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter spp. and diarrheagenic Escherichia coli were obtained on Days 1, 3, 4 to 5 and 21 +/- 5. Clinical response and safety were assessed on Days 1, 2, 3, 4 to 5 and 21 +/- 5.
RESULTS We isolated 127 pathogens from 121 (60%) patients: 73 (57%) Shigella; 23 (18%) Salmonella; 18 (14%) E. coli; and 13 (10%) Campylobacter. Overall bacteriologic eradication on Day 4 to 5 was 99% for Shigella, 77% for Salmonella and 77% for Campylobacter, with no difference between the 2 groups. Clinical cure or improvement was observed in 100 and 99% of the ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone groups, respectively. Serum ciprofloxacin values determined on Day 3 of the treatment were higher in the majority of patients than were the MIC50 and MIC90 values for the Shigella and Salmonella spp. isolated. Possible drug-related adverse events occurred in 13 patients [ciprofloxacin, 8 (8%); ceftriaxone, 5 (4.7%)] and were mild and transient. Joint examination was normal during and after completion of therapy in all patients.
CONCLUSION Oral ciprofloxacin was as safe and effective as intramuscular ceftriaxone for the empiric treatment of acute invasive diarrhea in ambulatory pediatric patients requiring an emergency room visit.

18189160,"Feasibility of two dose-dense FEC regimens with growth factor support for adjuvant therapy in patients with early breast cancer: results from a randomised study of the Central European Cooperative Oncology Group (CECOG).

Addition of epirubicin to adjuvant chemotherapy can provide important benefits for patients with early breast cancer, but the optimal dose remains unclear. Further improvements can be achieved with dose-dense regimens, but densification of fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (FEC) has proved difficult, with FEC(60) providing little benefit over standard chemotherapy and FEC(100) associated with toxicity. We investigated the feasibility of two intermediate dose-dense FEC regimens. Patients were randomised to six cycles of FEC(75) or FEC(90), with all three drugs given on day 1 of each 14-day cycle. Patients also received pegfilgrastim 6 mg as a single subcutaneous injection on day 2 of each cycle. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects receiving > or =85% relative dose intensity and was achieved by 96% and 88% of patients in the FEC(75) and FEC(90) arms, respectively. Of 147 FEC(75) infusions, 4.1% were delayed, while 9.8% of 143 FEC(90) infusions were delayed. The most common reasons for delay were adverse events and personal/logistical reasons. One dose reduction occurred during the study (FEC(90)), related to diarrhoea. Grade 3-4 haematological toxicities were reported in two patients in the FEC(90) arm. There were no incidences of febrile neutropenia during the study. The most common adverse events were increases in liver enzymes and gastrointestinal events; no event resulted in discontinuation. Only one patient (FEC(90)) experienced serious adverse events (vomiting and throat oedema). In conclusion, dose-dense FEC(75 )and FEC(90) are feasible with pegfilgrastim support. These regimens are associated with a very low risk of Grade 3-4 toxicity.

16505427,"Phase III study of two different dosing schedules of erythropoietin in anemic patients with cancer.

PURPOSE To compare maintenance epoetin alfa administered once every 3 weeks with continued weekly epoetin alfa for patients with cancer-associated anemia.
PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligible patients were randomly assigned at enrollment to receive three weekly doses of epoetin alfa 40,000 U subcutaneously (SC), followed by either standard weekly epoetin alfa (40K arm) or 120,000 U of epoetin alfa (120K arm) SC every 3 weeks for 18 additional weeks.
RESULTS Three hundred sixty-five patients were enrolled. One hundred eighty-three patients were assigned to the 40K arm, and 182 were assigned to the 120K arm. There was no difference in the proportion of patients requiring transfusions during the study (23% in 40K arm and 18% in 120K arm, P = .22) or specifically during the maintenance phase (13% in 40K arm v 15% in 120K arm, P = .58). Patients randomly assigned to the 40K arm were more likely to have a > or = 2 or > or = 3 g/dL hemoglobin (Hb) increment, were more likely to have a drug dose held because of high Hb, and had higher mean end-of-study Hb levels. Toxicities, including thromboembolism, and overall survival were similar. Patients in the 40K arm had a higher global quality of life (QOL) at baseline for unclear reasons, whereas patients in the 120K arm had a greater global QOL improvement during the study, so end-of-study QOL was equivalent.
CONCLUSION After three weekly doses of epoetin alfa 40,000 U, a dose of 120,000 U can be administered safely once every 3 weeks without increasing transfusion needs or sacrificing QOL. The Hb increment is somewhat greater with continued weekly epoetin alfa. Lack of blinding as a result of different treatment schedules may have confounded results.

11454878,"Recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma: a randomized phase III study of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin versus topotecan.

PURPOSE To compare the efficacy and safety of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) and topotecan in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma that recurred after or didn't respond to first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with measurable and assessable disease were randomized to receive either PLD 50 mg/m(2) as a 1-hour infusion every 4 weeks or topotecan 1.5 mg/m(2)/d for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks. Patients were stratified prospectively for platinum sensitivity and for the presence or absence of bulky disease.
RESULTS A total of 474 patients were treated (239 PLD and 235 topotecan). They comprised the intent-to-treat population. The overall progression-free survival rates were similar between the two arms (P =.095). The overall response rates for PLD and topotecan were 19.7% and 17.0%, respectively (P =.390). Median overall survival times were 60 weeks for PLD and 56.7 weeks for topotecan. Data analyzed in platinum-sensitive patients demonstrated a statistically significant benefit from PLD for progression-free survival (P =.037), with medians of 28.9 for PLD versus 23.3 weeks for topotecan. For overall survival, PLD was significantly superior to topotecan (P =.008), with a median of 108 weeks versus 71.1 weeks. The platinum-refractory subgroup demonstrated a nonstatistically significant survival trend in favor of topotecan (P =.455). Severe hematologic toxicity was more common with topotecan and was more likely to be associated with dosage modification, or growth factor or blood product utilization.
CONCLUSION The comparable efficacy, favorable safety profile, and convenient dosing support the role of PLD as a valuable treatment option in this patient population.

21106663,"Time-varying smoking abstinence predicts lower depressive symptoms following smoking cessation treatment.

INTRODUCTION The question of whether abstinence during the months following a planned quit attempt exacerbates or improves depressive symptoms is an important clinical issue. Extant research has primarily modeled between-person covariation between postquit abstinence and depressive symptom trajectories. However, this approach cannot account for potential third variables between participants that may affect both smoking and depression. Accordingly, the current study examined within-person covariation between time-varying abstinence and depressive symptom in a multilevel model (MLM), which allowed for transitions between smoking statuses within a participant.
METHODS Participants were 236 heavy drinking smokers in a randomized clinical trial testing the efficacy of incorporating brief alcohol intervention into smoking cessation treatment. Depressive symptoms and biochemically verified abstinence were assessed 1 week prior to and 2, 8, 16, and 26 weeks after quit date.
RESULTS MLMs indicated a slight increase in depressive symptoms over time in the sample as a whole. However, there was an inverse relation between time-varying abstinence (vs. smoking) and concurrent level of depressive symptoms, indicating that transitions from smoking to abstinence within individuals were associated with reductions in depressive symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS During the first 6 months following a planned quit attempt, being abstinent in a particular week appears to be associated with lower levels of concurrent depressive symptoms. These results are not concordant with the view that intentional smoking abstinence exacerbates depressive symptoms. Efforts to promote smoking cessation should highlight that individuals are likely to feel more rather than less psychologically healthy when they successfully quit smoking.
